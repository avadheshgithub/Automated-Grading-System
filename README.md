# Automated-Grading-System

## 📚 Student Text Analysis and Feedback System 📝

This project implements a machine learning model for text analysis and feedback, focusing on student assignments. The system reads PDF files, processes the text, matches keywords against a given solution, provides grading, and generates constructive feedback. Additionally, it includes a dashboard for visualizing student performance and analysis results.

## ✨ Features

- **Text Extraction** 📄: Reads and extracts text from PDF files.
- **Text Processing** 🛠️: Tokenizes, lemmatizes, and removes stopwords from the text.
- **Keyword Matching** 🔍: Compares student text with solution keywords and calculates match scores.
- **Grading and Feedback** 🎓: Assigns grades based on keyword usage and text coherence, providing specific feedback for improvement.
- **Dashboard** 📊: Visualizes performance metrics and feedback using interactive graphs.
