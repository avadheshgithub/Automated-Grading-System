# Automated-Grading-System

## Student Text Analysis and Feedback System

This project implements a machine learning model for text analysis and feedback, focusing on student assignments. The system reads PDF files, processes the text, matches keywords against a given solution, provides grading, and generates constructive feedback. Additionally, it includes a dashboard for visualizing student performance and analysis results.

## Features

- **Text Extraction**: Reads and extracts text from PDF files.
- **Text Processing**: Tokenizes, lemmatizes, and removes stopwords from the text.
- **Keyword Matching**: Compares student text with solution keywords and calculates match scores.
- **Grading and Feedback**: Assigns grades based on keyword usage and text coherence, providing specific feedback for improvement.
- **Dashboard**: Visualizes performance metrics and feedback using interactive graphs.
